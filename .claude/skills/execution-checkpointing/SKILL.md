# Execution Checkpointing

## Purpose

Capture immutable execution state at a meaningful task boundary.

## Output

- State
- Evidence
- Completed work
- Pending work
- Risks
- Continuation requirements

## Trigger conditions

- Trigger within declared scope when required evidence is available, or record its absence as a blocker.

## Inputs

- Task envelope with scope, acceptance criteria, risk, and relevant constraints.
- Current canonical project artifacts and observed evidence relevant to execution checkpointing.
- Any prior decisions, consumer constraints, or runtime context required by the procedure.

## Dependencies

- Canonical ATLAS contracts, project memory, and the closest mapped workflow.
- Repository/runtime inspection and validation capabilities the procedure requires.

## Limitations

- Does not grant authority to change assets, waive review gates, approve its own output, or expand task scope.
- Conclusions are limited to supplied and observed evidence; missing or stale evidence must be reported, not guessed.

## Validation

- Confirm every reported output is traceable to an input, decision, or observed artifact.
- Run applicable contract, schema, runtime, or repository checks named by the task and report failures and residual risk.
